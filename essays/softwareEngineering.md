First of all, what is a software engineer? Simply put, it refers to the engineer who develops and designs the mechanism that moves the action. I got interested in software engineering because of a small curiosity. From my point of view, the program becomes more complicated by connecting small actions with other functions, but since the functions are separated from the problem, if there is a mistake, it is easy to find.

The reason why I chose to major in computer science was simply that I thought programming was cool, and I was interested in creating a system in which a program is written inside an application that cannot be seen, and that it works properly. . In fact, programming was difficult, but solving errors one by one is fun because you can feel that you are approaching completion step by step like a game, but sometimes you get stuck without knowing the solution.

I think software engineers have to learn more about various things, but by acquiring knowledge, it becomes clearer to tackle problems, and it becomes easier to imagine which functions can be used to reach the goal. I think that will lead to the improvement of technology. In this ICS314, you can get more in-depth information about software, so I think it would be good to absorb a lot of knowledge in this course and make use of it in the future.

In the future, I would like to deepen my understanding of programming. ICS314 had a WOD (workout) and failed. It's going to be mediocre programming. If you do programming many times, you will know which function will work and what the result will be, but with WOD you only have to do it once, so I am familiar with programming on a daily basis and understand the mechanism and functions. I want to learn to be more efficient and less time tackling problems.
