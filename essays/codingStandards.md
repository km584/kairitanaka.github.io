title: "Coding Standards will help Programming"

I didn't think much about coding standards while writing the program. When I wrote a program before, I didn't care about coding standards, just adding comments to make it easier to understand what the function was. I still think errors are the only thing you care about when writing programs, do coding standards really matter in writing programs?

So what exactly are coding standards? Coding standards are tools that minimize errors and help programmers write code that is cleaner, easier to read, and more efficient. I see this coding standard as a facility for software engineers to build code that is more advanced and makes the functionality of the code easier for others to understand. For example, this coding standard presents various code improvements, such as lack of space in the code, use of the same variables, and extra variables because the called function is not used in it, and makes the code more efficient. You can make it easy to understand when it is beautiful and others see the program.

```
const cities = [];

function averagePopulation(cities, place)

  let populationPlace = _.filter(cities, function(num){return num['island'] === place; });

  let max = _.max(populationPlace, function(num){return populationPlace.island})
```
