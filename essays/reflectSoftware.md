## What I abosorb knowledge

Through this course, I learned various software engineering concepts that will be very useful in the future. What I learned in this course is useful in practice, such as how to design programs and how to use redundant functions, and these are useful when actually developing software.

## Functional Programming

Functional Programming is what makes work and efficiency when designing programs.The reason for this is that if you set a function in advance with a function, you can easily call the function just by pulling that function. And since there is no need to add functions one by one, you can save time by eliminating duplicate functions and their time. This functional programming reduces waste, so you can design programs efficiently, and by being able to design cleanly, you can more easily manage which function is used.
