## What I abosorb knowledge

I have receieved and abosorb much of the knowledge from this class. 

## Coding Standard


## Agile Project Management


## Design Pattern

I have experienced and used many design patterns in my software engineering classes. In JavaScript, you could use instantiation and call methods to use functions instead of writing them one by one. Objects can be cloned and new objects created using prototypes. By using various design patterns, programs become smarter and the code is easier to understand for other engineers to write efficient programs. And by using design patterns that past software engineers have discovered through trial and error, you can build faster and more efficiently.

Ultimately, design patterns are very important to software engineers because they can be mastered over the years by discovering and using more efficient ones. can reduce the time of software engineers and accumulate know-how. This encourages programmers to discover new design patterns that are more efficient and practical.
