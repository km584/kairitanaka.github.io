## Design effectively

Design patterns refer to design patterns discovered by software engineers in the past. In this design pattern, it is easy to name and reuse, so other people can refer to the design and write code that is efficient, easy to read, and easy to reuse. The greatest benefit of design patterns, I think, is that past engineers can master designs that have gone through trial and error.

The disadvantage is that the design pattern is not always correct and there may be extra cases, but these are problems that can be prevented with care. The use of design patterns makes the code easier to read, improves maintainability when modifying or expanding, and is very convenient and efficient because it can be used as a common language among engineers.

## What design pattern I used

I have experienced and used many design patterns in my software engineering classes. In JavaScript, you could use instantiation and call methods to use functions instead of writing them one by one. Objects can be cloned and new objects created using prototypes. By using various design patterns, programs become smarter and the code is easier to understand for other engineers to write efficient programs. And by using design patterns that past software engineers have discovered through trial and error, you can build faster and more efficiently.

Ultimately, design patterns are very important to software engineers because they can be mastered over the years by discovering and using more efficient ones. can reduce the time of software engineers and accumulate know-how. This encourages programmers to discover new design patterns that are more efficient and practical.
