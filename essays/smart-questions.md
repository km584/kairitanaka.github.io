## What could be a bad questions?

Sometimes people ask questions that they don't understand and this is because of the content of the question. The way to ask a good question is to write the question in an easy-to-understand manner so that the person who reads it understands why they are worried or stuck. This is
because the respondent does not know what to answer with a rough question because he does not know the questioner's situation or what he is 
confused about. And if you still don't understand after searching for a solution by searching on websites etc. before asking a question, you 
can write more details when you ask a question, so it will be a better question and the respondent will have a clearer solution to the problem
and can give you a better answer. Since the respondent does not know the details of the questioner's internal situation or the current problem, the question should be more detailed and give the information necessary for the respondent to recognize the problem.

## Bad question example:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37093182/why-my-program-doesnt-work

This is a bad question because the title is "why my program doesn't work" and it roughly asks do you know how to fix the error. It looks like you asked to fix the error without even searching. Since it was a vague question with no actual results from searching or doing different methods, the respondents didn't give a direct answer, and some gave hints, but I think this is a bad question because they don't know the situation.

## Good question example:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23411520/how-to-fix-error-laravel-log-could-not-be-opened

I think this question is a good question because you write down which error is causing the problem and you write in more detail what you did and take a picture. Here we have put enough information into the question to the solution so that the respondent can better understand what the problem is and what is causing the error.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a good question is to write a clearer question using the knowledge obtained from searching on the Internet, etc., so that the respondent can know in detail what the questioner wants to know about. can. And since the respondent has to know how much knowledge they have, how much they understand the current situation, and answer the situation with the information obtained from the question, if the question has more information, the respondent can imagine the answer. However, if this is a broad question such as what is JavaScript, the respondent will not know what to answer because it is a loose question. Therefore, before asking a question, I think it will lead to a good question by searching for the answer by yourself and clearly writing down what you want to ask about.
