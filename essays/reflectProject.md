## What I earned

Through this course, I learned various software engineering knowledge of functions call for semantic ui and bootstrap, also programming skills to convert the different type. This knowledge and skill could use in practice to improve and learn how differences on functions call or not calling like semantic ui requires to import the function but some are bootstrap could use function without import the function.

## Growth skills in this class

From this class we worked with team to create the web page for customer needs, so working on project it required to determine what kind of functions will make more benefits to user for smooth way to working in website. To discover problem or function that inconvenience could be find by self but the best way is to discuss with other people to how can improve more. This will able to share the progress of project and opinion to improve more and also it could share the problem of fixing or modified the code to improve the website. The other skill is that time management could level up if tried to working issues on time, so that will leads to working on same amount of time and make easier to manage the schedule to finish the project.

## In the last

What I learned in this semester gave me useful knowledge for software engineering practice. These are important skills for the future, so I will continue to aim for efficient software development by using these concepts and skills. Mostly focus on the time management to work finish earlier before the deadline to make more space to not rush up to finish the assignment.
