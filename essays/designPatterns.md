## Design effectively

Design patterns refer to design patterns discovered by software engineers in the past. In this design pattern, it is easy to name and reuse, so other people can refer to the design and write code that is efficient, easy to read, and easy to reuse. The greatest benefit of design patterns, I think, is that past engineers can master designs that have gone through trial and error.

The disadvantage is that the design pattern is not always correct and there may be extra cases, but these are problems that can be prevented with care. The use of design patterns makes the code easier to read, improves maintainability when modifying or expanding, and is very convenient and efficient because it can be used as a common language among engineers.
