<h2 id="what-i-absorb-knowledge">What I absorb knowledge</h2>

<p>Through this course, I learned various software engineering concepts that will be very useful in the future. What I learned in this course is useful in practice, such as how to design programs and how to use redundant functions, and these are useful when actually developing software.</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h2>

<p>Functional Programming is what makes work and efficiency when designing programs.The reason for this is that if you set a function in advance with a function, you can easily call the function just by pulling that function. And since there is no need to add functions one by one, you can save time by eliminating duplicate functions and their time. This functional programming reduces waste, so you can design programs efficiently, and by being able to design cleanly, you can more easily manage which function is used.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standard">Coding Standard</h2>

<p>Coding standards are a tool for minimizing errors and making code more organized and readable for other programmers in software projects by structuring programs according to guidelines for writing code. Writing code according to this coding standard helps software engineers build more sophisticated code and make the functionality of the code easier for others to understand. This improves readability and saves extra time when multiple people are writing code on a project, so they can work more efficiently. I think this will eventually lead to success in the project because it will be easier to understand where to fix when there is a problem in the code.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-last">In the last</h2>

<p>What I learned in this semester gave me useful knowledge for software engineering practice. These are important skills for the future, so I will continue to aim for efficient software development by using these concepts and skills.</p>
